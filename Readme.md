# Social Network Project
Project Description: "People" is the name of a social network platform. They want a nice looking responsive website where users can register, see other registered users on the platform and 'make a friendship' option. Registered users also must be able to see the people who are already in their friend list. Detailed requirementa are below.

## Acceprance Criteria
To pass this CodeReview you must fulfill the following criteria (MVP):	
- (15)	Create a database (cr13_name_people) and add sufficient test data (at least 10 users and 10 friendships (in total))
- (20)	Create a registration and login system
- (25)	Create a dashboard page for the user - when the user is logged in on the platform. You should display name and profile picture of the logged-in user and also display all registered users - with the option to make a friendship with every user (if they are not already friends on the platform). 
- (20)	When the user clicks on the button "make a friendship" it automatically becomes a friend with that person and you should display a message e.g. "Jane Doe is now a friend with John Doe".
- (20)	Display all friendships in the page friendships.php for the logged-in user
	
Bonus Points:	
- (20)	Create an accept a friend request option. In this case, the button on the dashboard page will be "send a friend request" instead of "make a friendship".
